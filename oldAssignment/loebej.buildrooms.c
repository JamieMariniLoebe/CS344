//**ASSIGNMENT 1: PART 1 OF 2**

/*STEP 1: The first thing your rooms program must do is create a directory called <YOUR STUDENT ONID USERNAME>.rooms.<random_number> where random_number is a random number between 
0 and 100,000. Next, it must generate 7 different room files, which will contain one room per file, in the directory just created. You may use any filenames you want for 
these 7 room files, and these names should be hardcoded into your program. */

/*The elements that make up an actual room defined inside a room file are listed below, along with some additional specifications:

A Room Name
	-A room name cannot be assigned to more than one room.
	-Each name can be at max 8 characters long, with only uppercase and lowercase letters allowed (thus, no numbers, special characters, or spaces). This restriction is not extended to the room file's filename.
	-You must hard code a list of ten different Room Names into your rooms program and have your rooms program randomly assign one of these to each room generated. Thus, for a given run of your rooms program, 7 of the 10 hard-coded room names will be used.

A Room Type
	-The possible room type entries are: START_ROOM, END_ROOM, and MID_ROOM.
	-The assignment of which room gets which type should be randomly generated each time the rooms program is run.
	-Naturally, only one room should be assigned the START_ROOM type, and only one room should be assigned the END_ROOM type. The rest of the rooms will receive the MID_ROOM type.

Outbound connections to other rooms
	-There must be at least 3 outbound connections and at most 6 outbound connections from this room to other rooms.
	-The outbound connections from one room to other rooms should be assigned randomly each time the rooms program is run.
	-Outbound connections must have matching connections coming back: if room A connects to room B, then room B must have a connection back to room A. Because of all of these specs, there will always be at least one path through.
	-A room cannot have an outbound connection that points to itself.
	-A room cannot have more than one outbound connection to the same room.

FORMAT: 
	ROOM NAME: <room name>
	CONNECTION 1: <room name>
	â€¦
	
ROOM TYPE: <room type>
